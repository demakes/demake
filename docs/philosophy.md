# Klaro Sites - Philosophy

Klaro Sites is a simple software tool for build web experiences. It is similar to Wordpress in that it can be set up easily, but it has several unique features:

* It's a single binary and can be used without any dependencies.
* It's extremely fast and can manage very complex sites.
* It's very secure and provides protection against most web vulnerabilities.
* It's every easy to use and extend while being more modern than PHP-based systems.
* It comes with support for bleeding-edge web technologies like progressive enhancement, live views and utility-based CSS.

Klaro Sites follows the "bundling" philosphy: Instead of requiring multiple tools and technologies to achieve a given goal (e.g. publish a modern website), Klaro Sites bundles everything into a single, focused tool that provides all the functionality in an opinionated package.

We believe this can make people more productive and reduce common issues at the same time:

* As Klaro Sites is a simple static binary, it doesn't require additional software to run on the server (e.g. a PHP interpreter).
* Klaro Sites provides a production-ready HTTP server including support for TLS, analytics, monitoring and security, hence it doesn't need to be run behind a reverse proxy or additional web server like nginx or Apache.
* Klaro Sites provides functionality to manage all aspects of web publishing including CSS, JS, HTML and file management, hence no third-party tools are necessary to build great experiences.
